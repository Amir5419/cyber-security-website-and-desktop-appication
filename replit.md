## Key Components

### Security Services
1. **Professional Security Tools Suite**: Integrated OWASP ZAP, Nmap-style port scanning, Nikto web vulnerability detection, Burp Suite HTTP analysis, and Metasploit-style exploitation frameworks
2. **Advanced Vulnerability Scanner**: Comprehensive detection covering OWASP Top 10, including SQL injection, XSS, security headers, cookie security, and protocol vulnerabilities with CWE classification and CVSS scoring
3. **AI Analysis Service**: OpenAI integration for intelligent security assessment and recommendations
4. **Report Generator**: Multi-format report generation (JSON, HTML, executive summaries)
5. **Penetration Testing Framework**: Professional methodologies including OWASP Testing Guide, PTES, and NIST SP 800-115

### Frontend Components
1. **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and activity monitoring
2. **Web Scraping Module**: Ethical data collection from approved targets
3. **Vulnerability Scanner**: Automated security assessment interface
4. **Penetration Testing Framework**: Professional testing tools and methodologies
5. **Report Management**: Interactive security report visualization and export

### Ethical Safeguards
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Restricted to approved educational domains
- User consent requirements for all scanning activities
- Educational context enforcement

## Data Flow

1. **Scan Initiation**: User creates scan through frontend form with ethical consent
2. **Backend Processing**: Server validates target, creates scan record, initiates scanning services
3. **Data Collection**: Web scraper collects structured data from approved targets
4. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Scanner analyzes collected data for security issues
5. **AI Enhancement**: OpenAI service provides intelligent analysis and recommendations
6. **Report Generation**: System compiles findings into structured reports
7. **Real-time Updates**: Frontend receives progress updates via polling
8. **Activity Logging**: All actions logged for educational tracking

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless recommended)
- **AI Service**: OpenAI API for security analysis
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Vite**: Fast development server with HMR
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for backend

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20, PostgreSQL 16, and web modules
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server on port 5000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic provisioning
- **Hot Reload**: Full-stack development with live reloading

### Production Deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, ESBuild bundles backend
- **Deployment Target**: Autoscale platform with external port 80
- **Asset Serving**: Static files served from `/dist/public`
- **Process Management**: Production server runs compiled JavaScript

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Required environment variable for PostgreSQL connection
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI analysis features
- **Session Security**: Production requires secure session management
- **CORS Configuration**: Configured for cross-origin requests
